    <div class="desc"><h3>China Grass or agar-agar, is a jelly-like substance consisting of polysaccharides obtained from the cell walls of some species of red algae, primarily from "ogonori" (Gracilaria) and "tengusa" (Gelidiaceae). As found in nature, agar is a mixture of two components, the linear polysaccharide agarose and a heterogeneous mixture of smaller molecules called agaropectin. It forms the supporting structure in the cell walls of certain species of algae and is released on boiling. These algae are known as agarophytes, belonging to the Rhodophyta (red algae) phylum. The processing of food-grade agar removes the agaropectin, and the commercial product is essentially pure agarose.</h3></div>
    <div class="para1"><p>China grass or agar agar is a plant derived gelatin, which is used in making puddings, jellies and custards. Agar agar is commonly known as China grass in India. China grass is a glossy pudding which is made by mixing sweetened milk with China grass powder. The pudding offers a range of benefits that make it a popular choice for dessert lovers. Firstly, it is a healthier alternative to traditional gelatin-based puddings as it is a natural product derived from seaweed. It is free from animal by-products, making it suitable for vegetarians and vegans.</p></div>
