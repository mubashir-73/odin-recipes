        <div class="desc"><h3>Pav bhaji (Marathi : पाव भाजी) is a street food dish from India consisting of a thick vegetable curry (bhaji) served with a soft bread roll (pav). It originated in the city of Mumbai. The dish originated as a fast lunchtime dish for textile mill workers in Mumbai. Pav bhaji was later served at restaurants throughout the city. Pav bhaji is now offered at outlets from simple hand carts to formal restaurants in India and abroad.</h3></div>
        <div class="para1"><p>Pav bhaji is a spiced mixture of mashed vegetables in a thick gravy served with bread. Vegetables in the curry may commonly include potatoes, onions, carrots, chillies, peas, bell peppers and tomatoes. Street sellers usually cook the curry on a flat griddle (tava) and serve the dish hot. A soft white bread roll is the usual accompaniment to the curry, but this does not preclude the use of other bread varieties such as chapati, roti or brown bread.A special blend of spices known as pav bhaji masala is used to flavor the dish, which is finished with lots of butter and cilantro!</p></div>

        </div>
        <div class="ingredients"><h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p><em>There are 2 parts to this recipe - the pav and the bhaji.</em></p>
        <ul> 
            <li><strong>Vegetables</strong>:  bhaji is made with mixed vegetables and the most commonly used vegetables in pav bhaji are potatoes, cauliflower, green pepper, peas. Carrots, beets, beans are also commonly used.</li>
            <li style="color: rgb(245, 144, 29);"><strong>Pav bhaji masala</strong>: the main flavor in the bhaji comes from a special blend of spices known as pav bhaji masala. You can either get it from Indian grocery store (I like Everest) or make it at home (see recipe below).</li>
            <li style="color: red;"><strong>Kashmiri red chilli powder</strong>: this is added mainly for color. Do not confuse it with regular chili powder, this one isn't hot.</li>
            <li style="color: yellow;"><strong>Butter</strong>: there's no good pav bhaji without lots of butter! I love using amul butter in my pav bhaji.</li>
            <li style="color: tomato;"><strong>Tomato puree</strong>: along with fresh tomatoes, I also like adding some store bought tomato puree for extra flavor. I would highly recommend not skipping it.</li>
            <li style="color:green"><strong>Garnishes</strong>: to finish the pav bhaji, you would need a good squeeze of lemon juice and lots of cilantro.</li>
            <li style="color: brown;"><strong>The Pav</strong>: is basically eggless dinner rolls. You can find them at indian grocery stores or you can also make them at home either, here are your options.
            <ul>
                <li>Regular burger buns</li>
                <li>Dinner rolls</li>
                <li>Hawaiian dinner rolls</li>
            </ul></li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="Steps"><h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Dry roast coriander seeds, cumin seeds, dried red chilies, cloves, fennel seeds, black cardamom and cinnamon stick in a pan on medium heat until fragrant, around 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Let it cool and then transfer spices to a spice grinder. Stir turmeric powder, ground black pepper, amchur, ground ginger and black salt.</li>
            <li>Grind until powdered and well combined. Store pav bhaji masala in an airtight container at room temperature and use as required. This makes around 100 grams of pav bhaji masala.</li>
            <li>Boil the veggies first and keep them ready.</li>
            <li> Heat 1 tablespoon of butter and oil in a large pot on medium heat. Once the butter melts and oil is hot, add the cumin seeds and let them sizzle.</li>
            <li> Add the chopped onions and mix. I like to use my food processor to chop them really fine.</li>
            <li>Cook the onions for around 4 minutes until golden brown in color. Add the finely chopped ginger, garlic and green chili. Again, I used my food processor to chop them really fine.</li>
            <li>Cook the ginger-garlic-green chili for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add chopped tomatoes and mix well. Let the tomatoes cook for 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add tomato puree, 1/4 cup water and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Cover the pan and let the tomato cook for 6 minutes until softened and completely cooked.</li>
            <li>Add the pav bhaji masala, Kashmiri red chili powder, red chili powder and remaining 1 teaspoon of salt. You may also add 1/2 teaspoon of sugar here (optional).</li>
            <li>Mix well and then add in 2 teaspoons of kasuri methi (dried fenugreek leaves).</li>
            <li>Stir in the boiled veggies and mix.</li>
            <li>Using a potato masher, mash the veggies until they are completely mixed with the masala.</li>
            <li>Add the remaining 3/4 - 1 cup water and mix. I used an immersion blender to blend the veggies to a paste like consistency, this is optional. You may keep them as such. Cover the pot and set heat to low. Let the bhaji simmer on low heat for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Open the pot and add in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter.</li>
            <li>Add a generous amount of chopped cilantro.</li>
            <li>Then add in juice of 1 large lemon. Let the bhaji simmer for 2 more minutes and then remove pan from heat.</li>
            <li>To toast the pav, melt butter on a pan. Sprinkle some pav bhaji masala on top of the butter and then place the buns on the pan. </li>
            <li>Press to toast the pav until crisp and golden brown from both sides.</li>
        </ol>
